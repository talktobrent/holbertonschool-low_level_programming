# 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
## At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
### 0. Linear search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
### 1. Binary search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
### 2. Big O #0
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
### 3. Big O #1
What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?
### 4. Big O #2
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
### 5. Big O #3
What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
### 6. Big O #4
What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
