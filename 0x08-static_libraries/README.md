<h1>0x08. C - Static libraries</h1>
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, <strong>without the help of Google</strong>:</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it</li>
<li>Basic usage of <code>ar</code>, <code>ranlib</code>, <code>nm</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
  <h3>
    0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life 
  </h3>
  <p>Create the static library <code>libholberton.a</code> containing all the functions listed below:</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
Don&rsquo;t forget to push your <code>holberton.h</code> file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.</p>
        <p>File: <code>libholberton.a, holberton.h</code></p>
  <h3>
    1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
  </h3>
  <p>Create a script called <code>create_static_lib.sh</code> that creates a static library called <code>liball.a</code> from all the <code>.c</code> files that are in the current directory.</p>
        <p>File: <code>create_static_lib.sh</code></p>
  <h3>
    2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
  </h3>
  <p>Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why use libraries</li>
<li>How they work</li>
<li>How to create them</li>
<li>How to use them</li>
</ul>
<p>Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>When done, please add all urls below (blog post, tweet, etc.)</p>
<p>Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings</p>
