# Readme
First, read quickly through Everything you need to know to start with C. You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first.

Then, read or watch: Dennis Ritchie, “C” Programming Language: Brian Kernighan, Why C Programming Is Awesome, Learning to program in C part 1 and part 2, Understanding C program Compilation Process and Betty, the official Holberton C coding style.

man gcc

man (3) printf, puts, putchar

(optional) And if you want to troll “C vs C++”, this is a very famous thread by Linus Torvalds.

You do not need to learn about getc or scanf.

## What you should learn from this project
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))

Who invented C

Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds

What happens when you type gcc main.c

What is an entry point

What is main

How to print text using printf, puts and putchar

How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof

How to compile using gcc

What is the default program name when compiling with gcc

What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style

How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function

How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements for C
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project

There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation

You are not allowed to use system

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

Requirements for shell scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
